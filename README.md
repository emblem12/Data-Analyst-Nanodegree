# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree

> I advanced my programming skills and refined the ability to work with messy, complex datasets. 
  I also learned how to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and created visualizations for data exploration. 
  Finally, I learned how to use the data skills to tell compelling stories.
  
  
  
# Project 1: Explore Weather Trends

> In this project, I mastered SQL, and learned how to download data from a database. 
  I also analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I reside to overall global temperature trends.
  
  
  
# Project 2: Investigate a Dataset

> I chose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. 
  I went through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finished by sharing the findings.
  
  
  
# Project 3: Analyze Experiment Results

> In this prject, I was provided with a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. 
  I then used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and reported the conclusions and recommendations in a report.
  
  
  
# Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data

> In this project, I used a real-world data which rarely comes clean and by using Python programming language,I gathered data from a 
  variety of sources, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it.I also documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, 
  and showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.
  
  
  
# Project 5: Communicate Data Findings

> In this project,I used Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. 
  Then, I created a presentation that communicated the findings to others.
